channel write & close gurantee

1, all pending queue would be flushed until we encounter a error
2, corresponding promise would be set and only be set at the time of ch_do_shutdown_write or ch_do_close_read_write
3, no additional outlets would be permited right after we call channel write  or channel close


todo:
1, we need a timer to check the underlayer transmission when we get write block  for both socket and mux_stream


optimization:
1, pipeline fire flow 


bugs:
1, mux_stream mwnd update issue,  
	issue: we've only count data->len() for uwnd now, but we've decreased m_wnd for each outlet

	
feature ?
1, new data arrive, but the state of the channel is in closing , what should we do ? we'll fire read for the current impl
